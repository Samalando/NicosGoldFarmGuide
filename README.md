## Description
It is a gold form that uses the player to lode in and kill the pigmans in one dimension.
It uses boats to remove the pigmans from the mod cap to increase the rates will killing the mobs.
The farm was first described in Nicos video "How to Design the MOST Optimized Gold Farm [Nerf Proof!]" [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTSFuNXbjqo*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTSFuNXbjqo)
## Setup
### General information
- If lazy place the schematic so that the top part of the glass is at build limit, this inshors that you only need to spawn proof a small amount of aria under the bedrock roth
- If you want marginally better rates place it lower but this mean that you need to spawn proof more of the aria under
- The farm needs to be placed a [Nether Wastes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Nether_Wastes)

## FaQ
- Do you need to use tinted glass
	- No you can use any block that is spawn pref(glass, leths, slabs)
- Can it work on a paper server
	- The design is compatible with standard paper but modification that the server owner dos to the server can change the behavior of it and therefore brake it 
- Why is there string in the schematic
	- The sting is placed as a interface layer round the "hat" to avoid priglins from pathinding on to that platform
- Why is the armor stand decaying
	- The problem is that you are using a sword with fire aspect
- Can you use sole fire instead of magma blocks
	- Yes you can, but remember to fireproof the farm firs
